# ApplyBot

The core-code of this was made a year ago, now I just changed the 'constant' variables to ENV and cleaned the code.

I made this bot for sending applies via Discord, but obviously you can edit it to suit your needs.

# TO DO (when I have time)

- Use slash commands instead of 'content.startsWith'
